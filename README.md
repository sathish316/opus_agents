# Opus Agents

Opus Agents is an open-source agentic AI framework featuring a suite of AI agents and customizable tools designed to enhance your productivity across multiple domains including productivity apps, collaboration tools, and software development.

The project draws inspiration from Neil DeGrasse Tyson's views in the podcast "Why AI is overrated" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYizgB2FcAQ). In summary, AI is anticipated to result in transformative capabilities comparable to humanity's shift from horses to cars. The exponential growth anticipated from AI is no different from the exponential growth we have seen in Industrial Revolution, Internet etc. Neil DeGrasse Tyson advocates for a balanced perspective, suggesting that AI will enable Jarvis-like capabilities for everyone, catalyzing the next wave of exponential growth.

Opus Agents is an attempt to make the tools we use everyday for Productivity, Collaboration, Software development etc feel almost like Jarvis. Key features are:
* Productivity tools
   * Todo lists - Ask your Todo lists what you did yesterday, last week, help you plan your day and prioritize Tasks according to your custom workflows
   * Notetaking - Ask questions to your notes
* Collaboration software
   * Google Calendar or Clockwise - Find out where your time is spent in meetings
   * Slack - Catch up on team-specific and project-specific Slack channels
   * Gmail - Catch up on important emails, categorize emails and achieve Inbox Zero
   * Zoom or Loom - Ask follow-up questions to your meeting transcripts

   * More powers coming soon...
* Security
   * Built-in data security ensures you can only authenticate and authorize tools through workplace-approved methods, Remote MCP servers, or OAuth
   * Your data remains on your local machine, and sensitive tools/features can be configured to run exclusively with Local LLMs such as gpt-oss, Qwen3, Ollama3.

Opus Agents provides capabilities beyond simply integrating MCP tools into Cursor. As an extensible and hackable framework, it allows you to add and customize your frequently-used software and tools to match your unique daily workflows.
