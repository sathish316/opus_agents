notes:
  obsidian:
    default_vault_name: "personal_notes"
    vault_configurations:
      - vault_name: "personal_notes"
        vault_path: "/path/to/personal_notes"
        vector_db_collection: "personal_notes"
        vector_db_path: "/tmp/data/chroma/personal_notes"
        exclude_dirs: ["ignore"]
        exclude_files: ["ignore.md"]
        num_results: 3
```

3. Install chromadb (vector database) to index and chat with your notes
https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/overview/getting-started

4. Index your notes. Opus updates only the changes every time you do this operation. It uses a local embedding model that comes by default in Chromadb and your notes are kept secure

```
 uv run opus_todo_agent/background_jobs/notes/obsidian_indexer.py sathish316_personal
```

5. Test Obsidian from OpusCLI

OpusCLI> Ask notes - what is X?

For advanced tools and workflows possible with Obsidian, check Custom Tools and Prompt library section

## Collaboration tools Usage - Mail, Calendar, Chat, Meetings

### Calendar - Google Calendar

1. Enable Google Calendar in ~/.opusai/opus-config.yaml
A higher order tool is a special type of custom tool that uses the MCP server to build advanced functionalities.

```
mcp_config.productivity.calendar.google_calendar.enabled=true
mcp_config.productivity.calendar.google_calendar.higher_order_tools.enabled=true
```

2. Google calendar works only with your personal Gmail account or if your workplace admin supports installation of custom apps. Perform the following steps to get the Auth config required for next step
https://lobehub.com/mcp/199-mcp-mcp-google#setup

3. Set the following ENV variables for Google calendar:
```
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="<your-key>"
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-key>"
GOOGLE_USER_EMAIL="<your-email>"
```

4. Google workspace MCP requires an Stdio transport version of MCP to be configured.
Clone this repo and configure an environment variable for Google workspace MCP to work.

http://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp

```
GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_MCP_PATH=/path/to/google_workspace_mcp
OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1
```

5. Test Google Calendar from OpusCLI

OpusCLI> What meetings do i have tomorrow?

6. Complete the OAuth handshake flow in your browser

7. The power of OpusCLI is in the advanced and hackable Google Calendar workflows that it supports to suit your needs. For advanced tools and workflows possible with Google Calendar, check Custom Tools and Prompt library section

### Calendar - Clockwise

In case your Google workspace permission does not allow you to use Google calendar, Clockwise provides Remote MCP servers with access to your Calendar and more optimization tools.

1. Enable Calendar in ~/.opusai/opus-config.yaml
A higher order tool is a special type of custom tool that uses the MCP server to build advanced functionalities.

```
mcp_config.productivity.calendar.clockwise.enabled=true
mcp_config.productivity.calendar.clockwise.higher_order_tools.enabled=true
```

2. Clockwise does not require any additional work other than OAuth handshake. Start OpusCLI and Complete the OAuth handshake flow in your browser

3. Test Clockwise from OpusCLI

OpusCLI> What meetings do i have tomorrow?

The power of OpusCLI is in the advanced and hackable Clockwise workflows that it supports to suit your needs. For advanced tools and workflows possible with Clockwise, check Custom Tools and Prompt library section

### Chat - Slack
1. Enable Slack in ~/.opusai/opus-config.yaml
```
mcp_config.productivity.chat.slack.enabled=true
```

2. Slack supports 2 different auth methods. Follow the below guide to get XOXC and XOXD token:
https://github.com/korotovsky/slack-mcp-server/blob/master/docs/01-authentication-setup.md

Enable xoxc in config:
```
mcp_config.productivity.chat.slack.auth_method: "xoxc"
```

Configure tokens in ENV
```
SLACK_MCP_XOXC_TOKEN=<your-token>
SLACK_MCP_XOXD_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

The disadvantage of xoxc and xoxd is that they need to be frequently updated.

3. For other auth methods, Slack integration works only if your workplace admin supports installation of custom apps. Perform the following steps to get the Auth config required for XOXP token:
https://github.com/korotovsky/slack-mcp-server/blob/master/docs/01-authentication-setup.md

Enable xoxp in config:
```
mcp_config.productivity.chat.slack.auth_method: "xoxp"
```

Configure tokens in ENV:
```
SLACK_MCP_XOXP_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

4. For advanced features, OpusCLI supports the following config for Slack to tell Opus about your specific teams and projects and their corresponding Slack channels:

```
chat.slack.project_to_channels.phoenix=["phoenix-dev","phoenix-product"]
chat.slack.team_to_channels.neo=["neo-dev","neo-alerts"]
```

5. OpusCLI supports Local LLMs to secure Slack data. In order to use Local LLM with Slack, configure:

```
chat.slack.use_local_model=true
```

6. Test Slack from OpusSLI

OpusCLI> Update me on the recent messages in Test slack channel in last one week

### Meetings Recording and Transcript - Zoom and Loom

OpusCLI does not direcly integrate with Zoom or Loom APIs. It expects you to download the transcript in a specific location and uses a Local model to answer follow-up questions about the meeting

1. Enable Zoom or Loom in ~/.opusai/opus-config.yaml
```
mcp_config.productivity.meeting_transcript.zoom.enabled=true
mcp_config.productivity.meeting_transcript.loom.enabled=true
```

2. Configure storage directory for meeting trancript
```
meeting_transcript:
  zoom:
    storage_dir: "~/tmp/opusai/data/zoom"
  loom:
    storage_dir: "~/tmp/opusai/data/loom"
```

3. This step is for additional security. Enable local models and token limit for Meeting transcripts. 
```
meeting_transcript:
  zoom:
    use_local_model: true
    max_transcript_size: 32000
  loom:
    use_local_model: true
    max_transcript_size: 32000
```

4. Go to zoom and download meeting transcript to ~/tmp/opusai/data/zoom. Zoom meetings have *.vtt extension. If your meeting is is abc13371337, the filename where the transcript should be stored is ~/tmp/opusai/data/zoom/abc13371337.vtt

To download transcript: Go to zoom.com > Sign-in > Recordings & Transcripts > Click on meeting id > Click on Audio transcript download

5. Go to loom and download meeting transcript to ~/tmp/opusai/data/loom. Loom meetings have *.srt extension. If your meeting is is abc13371337, the filename where the transcript should be stored is ~/tmp/opusai/data/loom/abc13371337.srt

To download transcript: Go to loom.com > Sign-in > Click on meeting > View Recording > Transcript > Download

6. Test Zoom or Loom on OpusAI
